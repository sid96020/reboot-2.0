Problem #1     Block System call : 
block system call for date command 
that means you don't have to uninstall date command but if you run kernel must not accept 
do the same Firefox as well

*Trying to read the doc of system call and restricted file, but didn't get anything properly 
 but still trying

Problem #2 :  play with directory 

  create a directory without name from command line
  create a directory with name "-okgoogle"
  
  solution: it is impossibe to create a dir without name or character so i create a a directory with the Unicode empty characters
            1. mkdir U+00A0      
            * Note:- to use unicode in linux we use (ctrl+shift+u)
                     U+00A0   is for *No-Break Space*
            2. getting invalid option error by creating dir with the name -okgoogle. to overcome this situation we use -- before name 
               mkdir -- -okgoogle 
               * Note:- we use -- to disable further option parsing
