Problem #1     Block System call : 
block system call for date command 
that means you don't have to uninstall date command but if you run kernel must not accept 
do the same Firefox as well

*Trying to read the doc of system call and restricted file, but didn't get anything properly 
 but still trying

Problem #2 :  play with directory 

  create a directory without name from command line
  create a directory with name "-okgoogle"
  
  solution: it is impossibe to create a dir without name or character so i create a a directory with the Unicode empty characters
            1. mkdir U+00A0      
            * Note:- to use unicode in linux we use (ctrl+shift+u)
                     U+00A0   is for *No-Break Space*
            2. getting invalid option error by creating dir with the name -okgoogle. to overcome this situation we use -- before name 
               mkdir -- -okgoogle 
               * Note:- we use -- to disable further option parsing

Problem #3 :  create a directory structure 

Note :   You are only allowed to use a single command and only one time
solution: mkdir -p A/{B/{G/K/Reboot.txt,H/I/Reboot.txt},C/{I/J/Reboot.txt,J/L/Reboot.txt},D/{F/L/Reboot.txt,E/M/Reboot.txt}}


Problem #4.  share and files and folder 


     create two users name jack and Jill  from command line
    create all the data under home directory of each users 
    login with jack user and create a file name  jack.txt using vim editor and write "hello jack"
    from jack user also create two directories name jack1 & jack2 
    now login from Jill user and create a file. Jill.txt using vim editor and write "hey jiil"
    from Jill also create two directoires named jill1 & jill2 


Important :  swap these files and directories in between users  and to swap don't use root account.

solution: steps to do the task:-
          1. useradd jill         #to add user
          2. passwd jill          # set password for the user
          3. useradd jack         
          4. passwd jack
          5. su jill               #switc user
          6. chmod 777 /home/jill   #provide complete access to the jill home directory for everyone
          7. mdkir /home/jill/jill1 jill2    
          8. vim /home/jill/jill.txt
          9. su jack                 
          10. chmod 777 /home/jack     #provide complete access to the jack home directory for everyone
          11. mv /home/jill/* /home/jack    # move all the files and from jill home dir to jack home dir 
          12. you can do the same for jack as well 
          
          Note:- stll finding the better approach to do this task.
